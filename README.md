The Young Man The Station: a LaTeX article template
---------------------------------------------------

The Young Man The Station is a LaTeX template built on top of the standard `article` class, and built on the notion that not all LaTeX-formatted papers need to use Computer Modern, be in two columns, or generally share the same old and tired look. The name of the template is a variation of a [standard garden-path sentence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldT2g2qDQNQ).

You can download the source [here](https://github.com/episanty/TheYoungManTheStation/archive/master.zip), or you can [see](https://github.com/episanty/TheYoungManTheStation/blob/master/TheYoungManTheStation.pdf) and [download](https://github.com/episanty/TheYoungManTheStation/raw/master/TheYoungManTheStation.pdf) the pdf file to see how it looks in more detail. For a starter, here is the first page:
